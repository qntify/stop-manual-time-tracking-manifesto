# Stop manual time tracking Manifesto

Agile took over Waterfall as a preferred software delivery methodology. There are even Agile Project Management tools out there. However, one thing seems to remain -- developers are still being asked to manually track time with a whole market of time tracking apps. Nobody likes to do it.

## The best time tracking app ever

The best time tracking app ever is ... the one that doesn't require manual time tracking at all. Today there is data everywhere accessible via APIs. Data with an actor and timestamp is pretty much a time record. Most likely there is already everything you need to compile a report.

## Agile time tracking

Fundamentally, in Agile you don't need to track time.

If you still have to -- use cycle time as your automatic timer.
